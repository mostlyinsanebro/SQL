-- 109. Foreign Key Constraints

-- Whenever you have a foreign key in a table, you need to set the constraints for that foreign key
-- and that proctects our data from getting corrupted.

-- In the enrollment table, the course_id is the foreign key that references the student_id in the student table 
-- and the course_id is the foreign key thata references the course_id in the course table. The combination of both 
-- these keys form the primary key in the enrollment table.


-- The foreign keys are named as:- fk_foreignkeytable_primarykeytable.

-- We can also set the foreign key constraints based on our use case or what the business tells:-

The constraints are as follows:-

1. Restrict :- This will restrict the action from happening for the primary key.

Ex:- RESTRICT DELETE -> will not let the delete hapen on parent table as well for the primary key of corresponding 
-- foreign key.

2. CASCADE:- Will update the foreign key accordingly, as the primary key is updated.

3. SET NULL:- On the primary key being updated or deleted, the foreign key will be set to null.

4. NO ACTION:- Same as restrict. It prevents or restricts the operation on parent key.

These are the constraints used in foreign key and we have to use them accordingly.
