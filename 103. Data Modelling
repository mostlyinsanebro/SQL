-- 103. DATA MODELLING

-- Data Modelling is basically the process of creating a model in order to store our data in the database.

-- It involves four steps.

-- Step 1.Understand the requirements.
-- This is the most important step in data modelling. We need to understand the requirements correctly in order to 
-- create an effective model.

-- Step 2.Build a Conceptual Model.
-- The next step is to build a conceptual model for the database. It is basically the visual representation of the database.

-- Step 3.Build a Logical Model.
-- Data Structures for storing data, it is independent of data technology.It just shows you the tables and columns that you need.

-- Step 4.Build a Physical Model.
-- It is the implementation of the logical model for a particular database technology.
-- Physical Model includes the exact datatypes supported to our database technology,info. about whether the column will pe nullable or not
-- the primary keys, info. about views, stored procedures,triggers and so on.
-- This model is very specific to database technology.
