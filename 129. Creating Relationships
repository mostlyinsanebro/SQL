-- 129. Creating Relationships

-- We have created the customers table and now we have to create a relationship between these tables.

-- For that, we will have to use the customer_id as the foreign key in the orders table. We can use the below query for that.

USE sql_store2;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;

CREATE TABLE customers
(
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name  VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    city    VARCHAR(255),
    state   VARCHAR(255)
);


DROP TABLE IF EXISTS orders;

CREATE TABLE orders
(
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY fk_orders_customers(customer_id)
     REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
     ON UPDATE CASCADE
     ON DELETE NO ACTION
);

-- Also, once we have created both the customers and orders table, we will not be able to delete the customers table
-- without having to delete the orders table because the customers table is now part of a relationship. For this,
-- we will first have to delete orders table because this table is dependent on customers table. After that only, we will be 
-- able to delete the customers table because that is now free from any relationship.
