-- 108. Foreign Keys

-- When we define a relationship between two tables, there is one
-- parent and one child. The parent is the one having the primary key
-- and the child has the foreign key.

-- Here, we have to define a relationship between a student and 
-- enrollment.

-- As we can not have an enrollment without a student, student is 
-- the parent and enrollment is the child.

-- We simply can not hav relationship between wo tables without a 
-- foreign key.

-- A foreign key is basically a column in a table that references 
-- the primary key in another table.

-- Now, we also make a one-to-many relationship between enrollment and course table.
-- Doing that, we will have the course_id as the forign key in the enrollment
-- table.

-- Now, we have to make a primary key in the enrollment table as well. For that, we have
-- two options, either add a new column enrollment_id in the enrollment table
-- and then make it primary key or make the combination of 
-- student_id and course_id as composite primary key. We are making the combination
-- as primary key as that will prevent us from enrolling the same student in the same
-- course twice.
