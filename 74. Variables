-- 74. Variables

-- We have several types of variables used with procedures in sql.

-- Type 1). Session or user variables -> These are the variables that are used at places like output parameters.

-- ex -> Set @variable = 0;

-- These variables are valid as long as user is logged into the sessions.When user loggs off from the session, these variable 
-- go out of memory.

-- Type 2). These are the variables that are defined in the stored procedures or fuctions.Their validity is also limited to the 
-- stored procedures.
-- These variables do not remain valid during the entire user session. They are valid only till the procedure of function
-- is in execution.

-- Often , these variables are used to perform calculations in the stored procedures.

-- risk_factor = invoices_total / invoices_count*5;

DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS get_risk_factor;

DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE get_risk_factor()
BEGIN 
  -- Use the declare statement to declare variables in stored procedures or fuctions
  -- like , DECLARE var data_type Default_keyword Default_Value
  DECLARE risk_factor DECIMAL(9,2) DEFAULT 0;
  DECLARE invoices_count INT;
  DECLARE invoices_total DECIMAL(9,2);
  
  SELECT COUNT(*),SUM(invoice_total)
  INTO invoices_count,invoices_total
  FROM invoices;
  
  SET risk_factor = invoices_total / invoices_count * 5;
  
  Select risk_factor;
  
-- The variables (risk_factor ,invoices_count,invoices_total) are valid only till this procedure is in execution.
  
END $$
DELIMITER ;

-- As soon as we finish executing the stored procedures, their local variables go out of memory.
