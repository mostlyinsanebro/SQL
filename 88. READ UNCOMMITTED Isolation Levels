88. Read Uncommitted

-- We are going to see the read uncommitted isolation level in action now.

-- Instance 1.

Use sql_store;
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
SELECT points 
from customers 
where customer_id = 1;

-- Instance 2.

Use sql_store;
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE customers
SET points = 20
where customer_id = 1;
COMMIT;

-- Execute till set transaction in first instance and then come to second instance 
-- and run all commands before commit one by one and then go to first instance 
-- and run the select statement.You will see that the points have been updated to 20 
-- for the customer even though it has not been committed yet.
-- This is the problem with read uncommited. It reads uncommited data and causes
-- a lot of concurrency problems.
