-- 8. The AND, OR and NOT Operators

-- These are used to join multiple search conditions.

-- Precedence of operators
()
AND
OR

means AND >>> OR

-- NOT Operator
-- It is used to negate a condition.
Select *
from customers
where NOT (birth_date > '1990-01-01' or points > 1000);

-- How to evaluate this condition
-- We can do this like following

Select * 
from customers
where birth_date <= '1990-01-01' and points <= 1000;


-- Simply negate all the operators that are there and remove the 
-- NOT operator.

-- Both these queries are equivalent.

-- Exercise
-- From the order_items table,
-- get the items for order #6 
-- where total price is greater than 30.

Solution:-
Select *
from order_items
where order_id = 6
and quantity*unit_price > 30;
