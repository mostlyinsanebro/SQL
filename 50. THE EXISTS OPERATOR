-- 50. The Exists Operator

-- Select clients that have an invoice

-- We can use IN operator or a join as well.


-- Using IN Operator

Select * 
from clients
where client_id in (
	Select client_id 
    from invoices
);


-- Using Inner Join

Select distinct i.client_id,
                name
from clients c
join invoices i
on c.client_id=i.client_id;


-- Using EXISTS Operator

Select *
from clients c
where EXISTS (
      Select client_id 
      from invoices
      where client_id=c.client_id
);


-- Take away from this lesson is that,
-- if the subqury that we wrote after the IN Operator,
-- produces a large result set, it is more efficient to use the exists operator
-- beacuse when we use the exists operator , the subquery does not actually return 
-- a result set to the outer query. It will return the value TRUE to the outer query as
-- soon as it finds a row matching the condition which is faster.


-- EXERCISE 342.png and 343.png

-- Find the products that have never been ordered.
-- Not Exists is the opposite of Exists Operator.

-- NOTE:- 
-- In this case we can use the IN Operator, but the subquery
-- for IN will return a vary larger result set, which will have a poor performance
-- if we consider tha case of websites like Amazon. For this case, we should use the 
-- EXISTS Operator, so as to improve the performance manyfolds.


Select *
from products p
where NOT EXISTS (
	  Select *
      from order_items
      where product_id=p.product_id
);
