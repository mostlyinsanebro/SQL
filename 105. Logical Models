-- 105. Logical Models

-- Logical models are more detailed than Conceptual Models.
-- They contain the info. about the data structures that we are going to
-- use to store the info. about the attributes and have more
-- detialed relationship between the entities.

-- Logical Model is independent of database technologies.

-- Type of each attribute is specified in this model.

-- While storing data such as names or addresses, we must split
-- it into smaller chunks such as first name, last name
-- or addresses into street, city, zipcode etc. so as to make
-- the querying and extraction of data easier.


-- There are mainly three types of relationships between the entities,
-- one to one
-- one to many
-- many to many

- others are just extracted from these.

-- Here, we had a many to many relationship between student and course
-- because a student can have multiple courses and a course can have multiple 
-- students.



-- Now, there is a problem statement..what if we need to know the date
-- a student enrolled in a course.

-- Diagram -> Logical Model.png

-- We can not put it in the student entity beacuse a student may enroll
-- in different courses and we also can not store it in courses entity because 
-- a course has multiple students..So what to do...


-- So, the enrollment date is an attribute of the enrollment. So, we will have to add
-- an additional entity for repreenting the relationshp between the student and course.
-- It is also used for storing the date of enrollment of a student into a course 
-- and we can also store the price a student paid to buy a course at that time.


-- Logical model gives us a structure for storing data.The entities that we have here
-- almost end up being tables.
