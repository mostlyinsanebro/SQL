104.Conceptual Models

-- In this chapter, we will be looking at conceptual models.

-- Suppose, we want to build a website for selling online courses.
-- We will first have to build the conceptual model for creating the
-- database of that website.
-- The conecptual model basically represents the entities/things/concepts 
-- and the relationship between them.


-- Quite often, these entities are like people, locations and so on.

-- In this instance, there are two entities , Student and Course.

-- Now, we need a tool to visually represent the entities
-- and relationship between them.

-- For that , we have two tools -> ER Model or UML (Unified Modelling Languauge).

-- ER Model is used for visually representing data models.

-- Tool for ES Diagram -> draw.io

-- Link for our Conceptual Model -> Conceptual Model.png (saved in this repo)

-- Data modelling is an iterative process.We have keep improving it.

-- Conceptual Model just gives us a high level overview of the business domain and
-- it keeps us and the business stakeholders on the same page.
