-- 66. What are Stored Procedures.

-- In our application codes where the code is written in Java or C#,
-- we can not write the sql code in the same place because these codes 
-- require some compilation and if we make some change to the sql code,
-- then we will have to compile the code again and again. To avoid this, 
-- we store our sql code in a stored procedure and call it from there. In
-- this way, we will not have to compile the code again and again , whenever
-- changes are to be made in the sql code.


-- A stored procedure is basically a block of sql code.
-- In our application, we simply call this procedure to
-- get or save the data.

-- Stored Procedures have a bunch of advantages

1. They are very useful in storing and organizing SQL code.

2. They provide data security.

3. They also help in faster execution ,as some procedures are used to store
  optimized code.
