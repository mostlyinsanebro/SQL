-- 137. Prefix Indexes

-- Now, if the column we want to create index on is a string column like char,varchar,blob and text
-- then , it may take up a lot of space and our index may be slower because it would not be stored in 
-- memory due to it's large size.

-- To resolve this, we store only the first few characters or the prefix of the column.
-- Example:-
-- Create index on the first_name column of our table.

CREATE INDEX idx_firstname ON CUSTOMERS (first_name(optimal_length));

-- The optimal_length field is mandatory in case of text and blob and optional in case of varchar and char.


-- To find the optimal length , use the following query and see which return the maximum unique rows.

Select count(distinct left(first_name,1)) from customers;  -- 10


Select count(distinct left(first_name,5)) from customers; -- 12 , so 5 is the optimal prefix length.
