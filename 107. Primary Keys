-- 107. Primary Keys

-- A primary key is a column that uniquely identifies each record in a given table.

-- In student table, we can not make the first_name or last_name or their combinantion
-- as primary key because they do not uniquely identify a row.
-- We can make the email as primary key because it uniquely identifies the rows but it 
-- is very long and it will be repeated in other tables as foreign key, so we 
-- introduce a new column to this table as primary key, the 'id' column.
