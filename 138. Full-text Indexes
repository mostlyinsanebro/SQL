-- 138. Full Text Indexes

-- These special kind of indexes are used to create fast and flexible search engines in our application.

-- Now, given a table posts and we want to get those posts whose title or body conatins 'react redux' in any order.
-- We can try to get it using the following query,

Select *
from posts
where title like '%react redux%' or
       body like '%react redux%';

-- Here, we will get the rows having this search phrase in them but will not get the react redux in reverse order or
-- react redux seperated by a word or something like that.

-- Also, if we use prefix indexes for these search phrases, we will still face problems because these search phrases may 
-- not be included in the prefix index length. That is why, we will have to use full-text indexes.

-- These indexes store the entire string columns, they ignore in, on , the and they store a list of words and corresponding to those 
-- words they store a list of rows that these words appear in.

CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_title_body on posts (title,body);

SELECT *
FROM posts
WHERE MATCH(title,body) AGAINST ('react redux');


-- We can also get the relevance score 
SELECT *,MATCH(title,body) AGAINST ('react redux')
FROM posts
WHERE MATCH(title,body) AGAINST ('react redux');


-- Now these search engines have two modes, one is the natural language mode and other is the boolean mode
-- through which we can include or exclude ceratin words from our search phrases just like we do with google.


Select *
from posts
where match(title,body) against ('react redux ' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
-- This will search for all the titles and bodies having react or redux and in any order.
-- We can also exclude or include some words in our query.


Select * 
from posts 
where match(title,body) against ('react -redux' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
-- This will search for all the titles and bodies having only react and not redux.


Select *
from posts
where match(title,body) against ('react -redux +form' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
-- This searches for all titles and bodies having only react and not redux and has form in any order.



-- For querying the exact strings, use double quotes like
Select *
from posts
where match(title,body) against ('"handling a form"' IN BOOLEAN MODE);


-- These indexes are used to build powerful search engines.
-- Use these indexes if you want to search in long length columns like bolg posts etc.
-- If you are searching in smaller length string columns like name, address then use prefix indexes.
