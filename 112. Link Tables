-- 112. Link Tables

-- Now, we want a many-to-many relationship between courses table and tags table. But, in the
-- relational models, we can not have direct many-to-many relationship between two tables. For that,
-- we have to use a link table.

-- For example:- We had a many-to-many relationship between student and course table. For that, we used a 
-- link table, enrollmenmt. In this case, we will use course_tags table where the course_id and tag_id will
-- be the foreign keys and their combination will the primary key.
