--7. The WHERE Clause

-- where clause is used to filter data

Select * 
from customers
where points > 3000;

-- For this query, the query execution engine will iterate over
-- each row in the table and evaluate whether the given condition 
-- is true or not. If it is true, then that row will be added to the reult set.


-- <> or != means not equal.

-- where state = 'VA' or 'va' is one and the same thing.

-- dates are not strings but we still use '' to enclose them.

-- Exercise
-- Get the orders placed this year()

Solution:-
Select * 
from customers
where points > 3000;



-- Query to get the current year
Select year(curdate());
