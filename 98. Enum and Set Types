98. Enum and Set Types

-- Enums are basically used to restrict the values of a column 
-- to a limited set of values or strings

-- This is how we can do it.

Alter table sql_store.products
ADD COLUMN size ENUM('small','medium','large');

Enums are also not reusable.

-- A better approach is to use a different table to use for this purpose as 
-- a lookup table.

-- Another data type similar to ENUM is SET(...)and both of these are bad data types.

Alter table products
add column size enum('small','medium','large');

UPDATE `sql_store`.`products` SET `size` = 'SMALL' WHERE (`product_id` = '3');
