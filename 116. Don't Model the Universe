-- 116. Don't model the Universe

-- Design the databases in a way that they support today's problems
-- and not future problems because that can create a mess.

-- Build a model for your peoblem domain and not the real world.

-- Keep it simple.

-- Do not be afraid of changes because in future you will  
-- definitely have to make them.
