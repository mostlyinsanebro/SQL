-- 118. Synchronizing a model with a database

-- Now, if we want to add a column 'coupon' to the enrollment table, we have 2 options for doing that.

-- 1. Add the column directly in the table in database but this will be problematic because we will have to 
-- make changes to the database in all the diiferent environments where our database is there. Take the case of 
-- large companies where different environments are there like dev, uat and prod.

-- 2. Other option is to make change to the model and sync it to the database to which we want to make the changes to. 
-- This is a batter approach.

-- For this, go to Database -> Sync to model -> choose model to which you want to sync to.

-- Here, we have added coupon column to the enrollment table.

-- When we synchronize our model to our database, the coupon column will start to appear in the enrollment table.
