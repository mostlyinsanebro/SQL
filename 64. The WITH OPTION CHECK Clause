-- 64. The WITH Option Check Clause

-- Sometimes, updating a row in a view may result in the deletion of that
-- row from the view. If you do not want an update statement to delete a row
-- from the view, then you can use the 'with check option' while creating the view.
-- It would give error anytime the update or delete statements are executed
-- which would result in the removal of some row.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW client_balance AS
    SELECT 
        invoices.invoice_id AS invoice_id,
        invoices.number AS number,
        invoices.client_id AS client_id,
        invoices.invoice_total AS invoice_total,
        invoices.payment_total AS payment_total,
        (invoices.invoice_total - invoices.payment_total) AS balance,
        invoices.invoice_date AS invoice_date,
        invoices.due_date AS due_date,
        invoices.payment_date AS payment_date
    FROM
        invoices
    WHERE
        ((invoices.invoice_total - invoices.payment_total) > 60)
        WITH CHECK OPTION;



-- when we try to execute the following statement, sql will give error after applying the check option.


update client_balance
set payment_total=invoice_total
where invoice_id=2;


-- if we execute the above statement w/o 'WITH CHECK OPTION', it will allow deletion of this row from the view.
