--67. Creating a Stored Procedure

-- We can create a stored procedure by the following syntax.
CREATE PROCEDURE name()
BEGIN 
    PROCEDURE BODY;
END

-- In MySQL, we will also have to change the current delimiter so that this block of code is treated as one and not delimited by ;

-- Here is how we do it,

DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE get_clients()
BEGIN
   Select * from clients;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
-- Change the delimeter to ; by using the above line.


-- The stored procedure can also be called in sql like,
CALL get_clients();




-- EXERCISE (356.png)
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE get_invoices_with_balance()
BEGIN 
  Select * from invoices where invoice_total-payment_total>0;
END$$
DELIMITER ;

CALL get_invoices_with_balance();
