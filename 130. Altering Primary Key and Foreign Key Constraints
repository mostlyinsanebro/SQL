-- 130. Altering Primary key and Foreign Key Constraints

-- In this lecture, we will learn how to create or drop relationships
-- between tables that already exists in our database.

-- We can use the alter command to add or drop the foreign keys in a given table.

ALTER TABLE orders
   DROP FOREIGN KEY orders_ibfk_2,
   ADD FOREIGN KEY fk_orders_customers(customer_id)
   references customers (customer_id)
   ON UPDATE CASCADE
   ON DELETE NO ACTION;

-- The only problem is that the foreign key name is not fk_orders_customers, it is being saved as orders_ibfk_3 for some reason.

-- We can also add or drop primary keys

ALTER TABLE orders
   DROP PRIMARY KEY,
   ADD PRIMARY KEY(order_id);
