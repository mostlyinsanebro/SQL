-- 134. Indexes

-- Indexes are basically data structures that database engines use
-- to quickly find data.

-- It is just like the index of a telephone directory.

-- Suppose, we have to query all the crores of rows in the customers
-- table and find the customers that have state = 'CA'.
-- SQL will have to query through each of the rows for finding this
-- and it will take time.


-- We can use index on the state column. We store only the state 
-- in our index which references to the records in the customers table
-- corresponding to the states. It makes querying the data much faster
-- because SQL will only read the rows corresponding to the index of
-- state = 'CA'.

-- Also, indexes are small enough that they can fit in memory. So, it 
-- makes it a lot faster to use them to find data as opposed to the databases
-- which are stored on disk.


-- But indexes come with a cost.

1. They increase the size of database because they have to be permanently stored 
next to our tables.

2.They slow down our writes as whenever we have to insert or update data in our table,
SQL has to update the corresponding indexes as well.



Design indexes based on your queries, not your tables because indexes are used to make our 
queries faster, not our tables.
