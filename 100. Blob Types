100. Blob Types

-- We use blob types to store the binary data like 
-- photos, videos and pdf's and things like that.

-- The following are the data types for it.

TINYBLOB

BLOB 

MEDIUMBLOB

LONGBLOB

-- But, we must not use these data types in MySQL as 
-- we should store structured relational data if we are working with a 
-- relational database.


There are some problems that arise with storing binary data in relational databases:-

1. Size of DB gets increased.

2. Slower Backups

3. Performance Problems

4. More code to read/write images.
