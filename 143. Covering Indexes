-- 143. Covering Indexes

-- In all the queries that we have used so far regarding the indexes, we have 
-- only picked customer_id column, what is the reason for that:-

Explain select customer_id from customers
order by state;


-- When we try to get the columns which are there in our index , then our MySQL
-- is able to cover the whole query using index only and full table scan is not 
-- done and thus our query is optimised. These are known as covering indexes.
-- Reason -> Indexes are stored in memory and not on disk and are thius faster. 

-- But if we try to get the columns that are not in the index, then query becomes
-- slower. So, see your where clause and try to include all or most of columns 
-- that are there in the where clause.
