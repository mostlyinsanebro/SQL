-- 66. What are Stored Procedures.

Let us take an example of an application. Suppose we have writtem our application code in Java and we are also 
using SQL to get the data in that application. If we write the SQL queries with the application code then we may face problems in the future.
Because the application code needs to be compiled and if we make changes to sql queries written in the application code, we will have
to do the compilation again and again. For that purpose, we use the stored procedures.

In stored procedures, we just write all the sql code in the stored procedures and call it in the application code wherever it is needed.

Following are thye advantages of Stored Procesdures:-
1. Store and organize SQL.

2. Faster execution

3. Data Security
