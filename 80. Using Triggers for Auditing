80. Using Triggers for Auditing

-- We have already used triggers for maintaing data consistency but we can also use triggers 
-- for logging changes to the data for auditing purposes.

-- For that, we can record all the transactions in a table 
-- for update. delete and insert in a table so that later we can see who made what changes and when.

-- For recording the logs, we are creating a table using below script.

USE sql_invoicing;

CREATE TABLE payments_audit
( 
   client_id    INT             NOT NULL,
   date         DATE            NOT NULL,
   amount       DECIMAL(9,2)    NOT NULL,
   action_type  VARCHAR(50)     NOT NULL,
   acttion_date DATETIME        NOT NULL
);

-- For each row meaning
-- It means that the trigger will be fired for each row in the table that is affected by the trigger.
-- It is known as row trigger.

-- The other types of triggers are statement level triggers
-- These are fired only once during each transaction , no matter the number of rows affected by the trigger.

-- Write a trigger which on inserting a row in payments table
-- updates the invoices table as well and puts its log in payment_audit table.

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS payments_after_insert;

CREATE TRIGGER payments_after_insert
   AFTER INSERT ON payments
   FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
     UPDATE invoices i
     SET payment_total = payment_total+NEW.amount
     WHERE i.invoice_id = invoice_id ;
     
     INSERT INTO payments_audit
     VALUES (NEW.client_id,NEW.date,NEW.amount,'Insert',NOW());
	
END $$

DELIMITER ;


Insert into payments 
values(DEFAuLT,3,5,'2023-01-21',100,2);

-- Write a trigger which on deleting a row in payments table
-- updates the invoices table as well and puts its log in payment_audit table.

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS payments_after_delete;
