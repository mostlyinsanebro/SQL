-- 111. NF - First Normal Form

-- The first normal form says that one cell should have a single value
-- and we can not have repeated columns.

-- Now, look at the courses table, we are going to have multiple tags
-- in a single column which is not desirable as per the 1NF. Also, we do
-- not know, how many tags we are going to use, so we can not also use tag1, tag2 ...tagn 
-- columns in that table.

-- So, to solve this problem, we will make a different table altogether
-- called tags and will have 2 column in it, tag_id and name and will have many to many relationship 
-- between courses table and tags table.
