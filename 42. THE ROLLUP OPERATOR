-- 42. The rollup operator

-- It is basically used to summarize the data of the whole result set.

Select 
	client_id,
    sum(invoice_total)
from invoices
group by client_id with rollup;


-- Now, I group the invoice_total data based on state and then city
-- and then do with rollup, then we will get the invoice_total
-- as per each city in every state but also we will get the summarized data 
-- of each state i.e. we will get the invoice_total of each state as well and we will 
-- get invoice_total of all the states combined as well. That is how WITH ROLLUP works.


Select
	state,
    city,
    sum(invoice_total)
from invoices
join clients
 using(client_id)
group by state,city with rollup;


-- Exercise 135.png and 136.png

Select name as payment_method,
       sum(amount) as total
from payments p
join payment_methods pm
	on p.payment_method=pm.payment_method_id
group by name with rollup;

-- Note: Always use the column name and not the alias name for grouping data
-- with (with rollup)
