-- 135. Creating Indexes

-- Take the example of customers table.Without index, when we run the query
Explain select customer_id from customers where state = 'CA';


-- result =:- 9, 18, 19

-- then the type is ALL means no index is there and rows = 12 which means
-- SQL has queriesd all the 12 rows in our table to find these rows.

-- Now, we create an index on customers table having state column.

CREATE INDEX idx_state ON CUSTOMERS(state);



-- Now, when we run
Explain select customer_id from customers where state = 'CA';

-- now, type is ref means index is there, possible_keys = idx_state, key = idx_state, rows = 3
-- means now only three rows were queried to get the result, which has decreased the time and cost of
-- our query directly.

-- possible keys are the possible indexes that can be used for the query and key is the actual index that
-- MySQL chose on the basis of best performance from possible keys.

-- Exercise (Write a query to find customers with more than 1000 points)

Explain Select * from customers where points > 1000;
-- rows = 12

-- Create index on it
CREATE INDEX idx_points ON CUSTOMERS(points);


-- Now, see how many rows queried for getting the result through explain
-- Explain Select * from customers where points > 1000;

-- rows = 7 and possible_keys = idx_points and key = idx_points.
