96. Fixed-point and Floating-point Types

-- For storing decimal type numbers , we can use these three data types.

1. DECIMAL(p,s) p = precision and s = scale

-- DECIMAL(9,2) can store 1234567.89

-- This data type is used to store fixed valued numbers.


-- If you want to store larger decimal numbers but do not need that much precision, then use the following
-- two data types.

2. FLOAT 4b

3. DOUBLE 8b.

-- Both these are used for storing values used in scientific calculations.
