87. Transaction Isolation

-- The lower isolation levels are faster because it does not need 
-- that much isolation but there are more concurrency problems in this case.

-- The higher concurrency levels are slower because there is more isolation and 
-- more resources are required i.e. memory and CPU in order to manage the transactions that have to wait,
-- but there are less concurrency problems.

The four transaction isolations are :- (364.png)

1. Read Uncommitted (Lowest Isolation Level) (Fastest Isolation Level)

2. Read Committed

3. Repeateble Read

4. Serializability.(Highest Isolation Level) (Slowest Isolation Level)


-- In MySQL, the default transaction isolation level is repeatable read.
-- Stick to the default transaction isolation level and change it only when you really have to.


-- See the default transction isolation level
SHOW VARIABLES like 'transaction_isolation%';


-- How to set the transaction isolation level

-- We can set the isolation level for a session or for all the transactions globally using 'SESSION'
-- or 'GLOBAL' as shown below.

SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE; -- for next transaction only

SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE; -- for a session

SET GLOBAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;  -- for all the transactions and sessions
