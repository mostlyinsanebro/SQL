--1. What is SQL

-- Database -> A database is basically a collection of data stored in such a way
-- that it can easily be accessed.

-- In order to manage our databases, we connect our system to a software
-- known as DBMS. We will tell DBMS to query or update our data stored in the database.
-- It will take those instructions, execute them on the database and will send the
-- results back to us.

-- There are various databases out there, these are mainly of two types
-- Relational and Non-relational databases.

-- In relational databases, we store data in tables that are linked to each
-- other using relationships.

 -- Each table stores data about a specific type of object, like customer,products
-- orders and so on.

-- SQL is the language that we use to work with these RDBMS.

-- In non-relational databases, we do not have tables or relationships.
-- These are very different from relational databases. Non-relational DBMS don't understand SQL.
