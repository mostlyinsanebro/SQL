-- 52. Subqueries in the From Clause

-- We can also use subqueries in the from cluase
-- of a select statement in order to select the 
-- result of that query and then can filter data on it
-- or join the data of that subquery with some other data.



Select * 
from (
		Select distinct client_id,
						name,
						(select sum(invoice_total) 
						 from invoices 
						 where client_id=c.client_id) as total_sales,
						 (select avg(invoice_total) from invoices) as average,
						 (select total_sales - average) as difference 
		from clients c
) as sales_summary
where total_sales is not null;



-- This can also be achieved with the help of views which we will study later.
