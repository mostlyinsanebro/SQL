-- 12. The REGEXP Operator

-- The regular expresion operator allows us to search for more
-- complex patterns than like operator.

-- ^ = beginning of string

-- $ = end of string

-- | = logical or

-- [abcd]h = means will look for a string having 
-- a or b or c or d before h.

-- [a-g]h = means will look for a string having any character
-- from range a to g before h.

-- Exercise
-- Get the customers whose first names are elka or ambur
Solution:-
Select * from customers 
where first_name regexp 'elka|ambur';

-- last names end with ey or on
Select * from customers 
where last_name regexp 'ey$|on$';


-- last name starts with my or contains se
Select * from customers
where last_name regexp '^my|se';


-- last name contains B followed by R or U.
Select * from customers
where last_name regexp 'b[ru]';
