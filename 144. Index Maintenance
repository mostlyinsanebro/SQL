-- 144. Index Maintenance

-- Watch out for duplicate indexes and redundant as you keep on creating 
-- the indexes.

-- MySQL does not stop you from creating duplicate index so check the previos 
-- indexes before creating new ones.

-- Before creating a new index, always check the existing indexes and check
-- for duplicate or redundant or unused index if they are there.


-- Redundant Indexes:-
Index on A is redundant index to index on A,B because A,B can be used to optimise the
same query that A, B can be used for.

-- But B is not redundant index to A,B because they satisfy different queries.
