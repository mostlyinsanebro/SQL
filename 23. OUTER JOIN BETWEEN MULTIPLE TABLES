-- OUTER JOINS BETWEEN MULTIPLE TABLES

-- As best practice, avoid right joins and use left joins instead
-- if you need to perform an outer join.

SELECT c.customer_id,
	   first_name,
       order_id
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
	ON o.customer_id=c.customer_id
LEFT JOIN shippers sh
	ON sh.shipper_id=o.shipper_id;
