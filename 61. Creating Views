-- 61. Creating Views

-- If we want the result of a complex query again and again
-- then , instaed of writing that query again and again, we can 
-- create a view out of it. Which will give us the ready result of that complex query.


-- The views does not actually store any data
-- They just provide us a view to the underlying tables.


-- We can put conditions on a view, join it with other tables
-- and so on.


CREATE VIEW sales_by_client AS
Select 
    c.client_id,
    name,
    sum(invoice_total) as total_sales
from invoices i
join clients c
using (client_id)
group by client_id
    


-- We can put conditions on a view and do joins as well.
select * from sales_by_client
where total_sales>500;

CREATE VIEW clients_balance as
Select 
      client_id,
      name,
      SUM(invoice_total) - SUM(payment_total) as balance
from clients c
join invoices i
 USING(client_id)
group by client_id;


select * from clients_balance;
