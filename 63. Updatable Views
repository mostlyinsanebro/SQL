-- 63. Updatable Views

-- We can also do insert, update and delete statements in our views
-- but only under the condition that they do not have :

-- distinct 
-- aggregate functions
-- group by/ having
-- union 
in them.


-- If we do not have the above things in our view, then we call it as an updatable view,
-- which means that we can update data through it.
