-- 14. The ORDER BY Clause

-- used to sort data in queries

-- customer_id column is the default sort column because it is
-- the primary key of this table.
 
-- We can change it through order by clause.

-- In MySQL, we can sort data based on columns that are not there
-- in the select clause but we can not do that in other sql langages.
-- We can also sort by an alias.

-- Exercise
-- order by exercise.png
-- produce the result shown in screenshot
-- order by total_price in descending order.

Solution:-
Select *
from order_items
where order_id = 2
order by quantity*unit_price desc;
