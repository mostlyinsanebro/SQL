91. SERIALIZABLE Transaction Isolation Level

-- This transaction isolation level allows only one transaction 
-- to run at a time. So, this prevents any phantom reads that may be there.

-- Instance 1.
Use sql_store;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
START TRANSACTION;
Select * from customers where state = 'VA';
COMMIT;


-- Instance 2.
USE sql_store;
START TRANSACTION;
Update customers 
set state = 'VA'
where customer_id = 3;
COMMIT;

-- Serializable allows only one transaction to take place at a time and thus prevents
-- any concurrency problem that may be there, because there is no concurrency at all at 
-- this isolation level.

-- The first transaction can not start until the second one is fully committed
-- and thus prevents the problem.
