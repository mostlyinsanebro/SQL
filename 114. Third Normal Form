-- 114. Third Normal Form

-- Third normal form states that a column in a table
-- should not be derived from other columns..


-- Example:- Suppose we have a table having three columns.
invoice_total             payment_total                balance
  100                         40                         60

-- Here, the balance is derived from substracting the payment_total from invoice_total,
-- which is not right, because incase the payment_total changes, we will also have to update
-- balance and incase if we forget to update it, it will be problematic.

-- So, the right approach is to use only the invoice_total and payment_total columns, because we 
-- can always derive the balance from these two columns.

-- Hence, 3NF also helps us to reduce data redundancy and maintain data integrity.
