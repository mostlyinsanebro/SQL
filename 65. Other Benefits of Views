-- 65. Other Benefits of Views

-- The benifits of using views are:-

1. They help us to simplify our queries.

2.Reduce the impact of changes - This means that if our table on which our several queries are written undergo a change such as 
deletion of a column etc, then it would vastly impact all the queries written on it.

But if write a view which is similar to our table and then write queries based on that view, 
then even if our table gets changed, we can always make a slight change to our view
and we will not have to change our queries. This saves a lot of time and effort.

In short, views provide data abstraction.

3. We can also use to reduce the access to the data in the underlying table.
