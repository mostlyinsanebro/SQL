-- The Having Clause

-- Having clause is basically used to filter the data after our rows
-- have been grouped as per a column.
-- Where clause is used to filter the rows before the 
-- data is grouped.


-- Query to get the clients having the invoices_total>500
Select
    client_id,
	sum(invoice_total) as total_invoices
from invoices
group by client_id
having total_invoices>500


-- The other difference between having and where clause is that
-- in where clause, we can also select the column that is
-- not there in the select clause
-- but in having , we can not do that. We will have to select 
-- a column from the select clause only..alter

-- Write a query to get the total_invoices for each client
-- and also put the condition of only getting
-- the results where the invoice_total> 500 and count_of_invoices>5.

Select
    client_id,
    sum(invoice_total) as total_of_invoices,
    count(invoice_total) as count_of_invoices
    from invoices
group by client_id
having total_of_invoices>500 and count_of_invoices>5
