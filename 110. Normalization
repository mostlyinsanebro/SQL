--110. Normalization

-- While designing our databases, we have to make sure that our database does not allow redundant or duplicate data
-- because redundant data makes the process of updation, insertion and deletion more complex and also increases the
-- size of our database.

-- For example:- We are using a name column in several different places and we are making changes in the name. Then,
-- we will have to make sure that we make change in all the places, otherwise we will have inconsistent data and 
-- that will be problematic.

-- That is where normalization comes to the rescue.

-- Normalization is basically the process of looking at a database and making sure it is following some predefined rules
-- that prevent data redundancy from happening. 

-- For most of the applications,we only need to apply the first three normal forms.
-- 1NF
-- 2NF
-- 3NF
