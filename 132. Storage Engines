-- 132. Storage Engines

-- We have various storage engines in MySQL and these storage engines show us
-- how the data is stored and what features are available to us like transactions etc.

-- If we type 'Show Engines', we can see all the storage engines that are supported in MySQL.

-- The most most used Storage Engines -- MYISAM Aand INNODB.

-- INNODB supports all the current functionalities that are there like Transactions etc.These are not supported by MyISAM.

-- We set the storage engines at the table level,so we use multiple storage engines in the same database.

ALTER TABLE customers
 ENGINE = InnoDB;

-- Changing the storage engine of a table can be an expensive as MySQL has to rebulid the whole table again
-- and during that time the table is not accessible, so we should do it during scheduled maintenance if we are
-- doing it in production.
