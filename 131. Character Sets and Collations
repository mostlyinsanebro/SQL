-- 131. Character Sets and Collations

-- A character set is basically a table which maps each character to a 
-- number.

-- Different character sets support different languages.- Asian, Latin, English etc.

-- To view all the character sets supported in current version of Mysql, use 
SHOW CHARSET;

-- With the utf8 character set, we can store the data in pretty much all the 
-- languagess.
-- This is also the default character set supported in current version of MySQL.

-- So, when we create a database in our MySQL, our database supports international
-- languages.

-- The maxlen of utf8 is 3 which means that MySQL uses a maximum of 3 bytes to 
-- store each character.

-- We can set the character set while creating database or alter it.

CREATE DATABASE db1
   CHARACTER SET latin1;

ALTER DATABASE db1
   CHARACTER SET latin1;

-- We can also define character set for a table

CREATE TABLE table1 
()
CHARACTER SET latin1;

create table table1
( name varchar(5) CHARACTER SET utf8 not null);




ALTER TABLE table1
()
CHARACTER SET latin1;

-- We can also set the character set for a column like below:-
CREATE TABLE table1
( name VARCHAR(50) CHARACTER SET latin1 NOT NULL
);
