-- Delete row from invoices table where invoice_id=1

Delete from invoices 
where invoice_id=1;



-- Note: I tried to delete the rows from invoices table 
-- where client_id=1, but it gave an error saying can't delete a parent row.
-- Reason was, there was no entry for client_id=1 in invoices at that time.



-- Delete the invoices of Myworks client.
Delete from invoices
where client_id in
			(Select client_id
