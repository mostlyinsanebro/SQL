-- 119. Reverse Engineering a database

-- What if we want to change a database that does not have a model
-- For that, we will have to create a database model from a database.
-- and for that, we will have to reverse engineer that database.

-- For that, go to Database Menu -> Reverse engineer -> Choose the
-- default settings and reverse engineer the model.

-- This will give us the model showing all the relationships between
-- the tables and the faults in our design as well.
