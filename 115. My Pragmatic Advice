-- 115. My Pragmatic Advice

-- pragmatic ==> practical

-- We do not have to worry about remembering all the Normal Forms rather
-- we should be concerned about removing redundancy from our tables and not worrying about the normal forms.

-- Whenever you see duplicated values and these values are not foreign keys, then that means
-- that your tables are not normalized. Just think about eliminating the duplication from the database.

-- First of all while trying to remove redundancy, think about the logical entities and then the 
-- relation between them.Then, convert that logical model to a physical model.

-- Don't jump into creating tables directly and also take into consideration the requirements, do not apply
-- normalization blindly.

-- Example..

                              Customers
 Customer_id                     Name                      Shipping Address
     1                         Abhinav                  Plot no-13, Street No-1, Gobindgarh farm, Jagadhri
     1                         Abhinav                  Room no-24, 321, Umrao PG

-- Here, the customer is being repeated again and again for a different shipping address and if we had more columns like
-- email and phone-number , then the redundancy would be even more.

-- In order to solve this, we will first create a logical model and see which entities are there and what is the relationship between them.
       
                  Customer ----------1:n----------> Address

-- Then , we will create a physical model out of it.

            Customers                                                      Adresses
Customer_id            Name                              Customer_id                    Shipping Address
     1               Abhinav                                 1                       Plot no-13, Street No-1, Gobindgarh farm, Jagadhri
                                                             1                       Room no-24, 321, Umrao PG

-- In this way, we have removed the redundancy, without keeping the track which normal form to be followed, which is the right approach.
