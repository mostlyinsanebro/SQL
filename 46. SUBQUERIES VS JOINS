-- 46. SUBQUERIES VS JOINS

-- We can use joins inplace of subqueries sometimes.
-- We should always choose between the two of them based
-- on the readibility of the code.

-- Find clients with no invoices
Select * from clients
where client_id not in 
(Select distinct client_id
from invoices); 


-- or we can use joins for this purpose

Select * 
from clients c
left join invoices i
	using (client_id)
where invoice_id is null;


-- Exercise 147.png


-- Using Joins
Select distinct customer_id,
       first_name,
       last_name 
from customers c
join orders o
	using (customer_id)
join order_items oi
	using (order_id)
where product_id=3;




-- Using subqueries
Select 
       customer_id, 
	   first_name,
       last_name 
       from customers
where customer_id in (
Select customer_id from orders
where order_id in (
			Select order_id
			from order_items
			where product_id=3
		)
)
