-- 35. Updating Multiple Rows

Update invoices
set payment_total=invoice_total*0.5,
	payment_date=due_date
where client_id=3;


-- If you want to update all the rows of a table
-- then, we need to leave the where clause only from the update statement
-- and that will do it.

Update invoices set
payment_total=invoice_total*0.5,
payment_date=due_date;


-- But for this, we will have to turn off the safe update from MYSQL Workbench icon -> preferences -> Turn off Safe Updates.


-- Exercise
-- Write an SQL query to give any customers born before
-- 1990 50 extra points.

Update customers
set points=points+50
where birth_date<'1990-01-01';
