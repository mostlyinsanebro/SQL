-- 113. Second Normal Form

-- The second normal form states that every table should represent one entity
-- and every column in that table should describe that entity.

-- Take the example of courses table here, 
-- this table is representing a single entity -> course and every column in this table
-- is describing that entity -> courses.

-- In case, we have a different column that is not an attribute or property of that entity,
-- then we will put that column in a different table.

-- For example, we put the enrollment in a different table because it is not describing the
-- course entity.

-- The second normal form says that every column in a table should describe the entity that the
-- table represents.



-- Another example :-

-- While seeing a database whether it is following 2NF or not, we have to make sure that each column 
-- of that table is describing the entity that the table represents. Also, we have to make sure that
-- each of the column is not duplicated, if it is, try to minimize it by introducing another table.

-- In our data model, one of the table is not following the 2NF..

-- It is the courses table. It has instructors column in it, which does not really represent the course
-- entity and can also be duplicated many times. To solve this, we can introduce another table here
-- having instructor_id and name and have one-to-many relationship between courses and instructors table.
