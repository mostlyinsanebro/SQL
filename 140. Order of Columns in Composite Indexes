-- 140. Orders of columns in Composite Indexes

-- The order of columns in indexes is determined by the following rules.

-- Rule 1 . Use the most frequently used columns first.
-- meaning if we have 5 queries and all these queries are making use of state column
-- to search, then it makes sense to create an index that have state column in it first.


-- Rule 2. Use the columns having a higher cardinality first in our indexes but always look 
-- at the queries and then decide which order is the most optimal for it beacuse we can not 
-- create a general index which is optimal for all the queries.


-- We can also use an index of our choice by using the following query,

Select *
from customers
USE INDEX (idx_lastname_state)
where state = 'CA' and last_name like 'A%';
