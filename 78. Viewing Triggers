-- 78. Viewing Triggers

-- In mysql workbench, there is no way to see triggers
-- we can only see tables, stored procedures, functions and views.

-- Thus, to see triggers we will have to use "Show Triggers" statement
-- to view all triggers in the current database.

-- for viwing a trigger related to a specific table, 
-- we can use 
 Show triggers like 'payments%';

Here is the convention for naming the triggers,

table_name_before-or-after_action.

e.x:- payments_after_insert


-- We can also use the like statement to search for triggers
-- based on a specific condition like this.


Show triggers where event like 'INSERT%';
