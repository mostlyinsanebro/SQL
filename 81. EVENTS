81. Events

-- An event is a task or block of code which gets executed according
-- to a schedule.

-- So, with events we can automate the database tasks such
-- as deleting stale data or copying data to an archive table
-- or aggregating data to create reports.

-- Before we can schedule an event, we need to turn on MySQL event scheduler.
-- It is basically a job/process which is constantly looking for events to execute.


-- We can turn the event scheduler on or off , depending on our need like this:-

-- Show Variables like 'event%';

-- Set global event_scheduler = ON/OFF;


-- This event will delete rows from payments_audit table which 
-- are older than 1 year it is scheduled to run every year from 2023 to 2029.
